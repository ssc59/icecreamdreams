# Ice Cream Dreams – Final Project

This is my final project called **Ice Cream Dreams**. It's a fun website that shows different ice cream flavors and a retro ice cream stand design.

## What’s Inside

- A main webpage: `index.html`
- A stylesheet: `style.css`
- A bunch of images: flavors, ice cream stands, icons, and a logo

## What I Used

- HTML and CSS
- Custom images and SVGs
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

##  Features

- Cool layout with pictures of ice cream
- A menu icon that works on mobile
- Clean and colorful design
